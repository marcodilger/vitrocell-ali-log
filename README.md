# vitrocell-ali-log
Small script to analyze and plot sensor &amp; cell exposure data from logfiles generated by Vitrocell air-liquid interface exposure systems [VITROCELL Automated Exposure Station](https://www.vitrocell.com/inhalation-toxicology/exposure-systems/automated-exposure-station1).
Should work with all currently deployed units and configurations (Jan 2019).

This script was very handy during the demanding [HICE](https://www.hice-vi.eu) campaigns, where the exposure systems were pushed to their limits, and sometimes sensor failures could be detected early by looking at time-courses of sensor data and other issues could be diagnosed retrospectively.
